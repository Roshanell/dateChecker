Welcome to the Date Checker App!

This app is a simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app's primary function is to allow me to work more with JS Dates. With this app, users can check to see what is the current date. 

## How it's made:

The app was developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML was used to structure the app and provide the necessary input fields and buttons. The CSS was used to style the app and make it visually appealing, while the JavaScript was used to implement the date checking functionality.

The date checking functionality was implemented using the JavaScript Date object, which allows for easy manipulation and comparison of dates. The app checks whether the input date is a valid date or not, and displays the result to the user.

## Optimizations:

This app could also be extended to check the time as well. 

## Lessons learned:

During the learning process keep building and keep having fun!

## Getting started:

To get started with the Date Checker App, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. The app will load and you can begin using it by inputting a date in the specified format.
